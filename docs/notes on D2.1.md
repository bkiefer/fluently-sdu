Following upon the online session, the visit at the facility in Turin and the subsequent discussion it was
highlighted that, amongst the various types of batteries, the NMC chemistries cylindrical cells are far the
most used in EVs and consumer products. Two references, namely 18650 and 21700, are the most adopted
format both in the e-bike and on several other types of EVs. Additionally, the 4680 are currently adopted by
several auto OEMs.

Major bottlenecks in the
automation were identified with respect to two workflows: battery pack disassembly (phase 1) (focus) and cell
disassembly allowing for clean material recovery (phase 2).


Initially, we will establish a testbed to
develop, integrate and demonstrate novel technologies for automating the disassembling process of e-bikes
battery packs using NMC 21700 cylindrical cells. Currently, these battery cells are the most produced type
of cells and have a wide range of applications from laptop batteries to EV and e-bikes. Further down the
road of the implementation of the Fluently solution, additional considerations will be made with respect to
the automation tasks in order to accommodate other types of battery packs (cells with different chemistry,
shape and size) while reducing the change-over time.

The automation challenge requires the testbed to be collaborative with true human robot interaction
(power & force limiting - ISO/TS15066) because many processes like discharging and voltage
measurement must be done by humans.
